> pim (short for "pretty vim"), derived from the Dutch name [Pim](https://nameberry.com/babyname/pim/boy) 

pim was my personal answer to the question of my personal preferences; minimalism or ease of us. Why not both? 
pim makes it easy to make amazing Neovim using experiences, without sacrificing performance, mainly because
*everything* is lazily loaded, powered by the amazing [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) package manager. 
After all, the end goal of pim is to be used as a base framework, to be further extended on by the end-user.

pim is designed to be fast and extensive; thus the following design principles were applied:

- **Speed**. It runs incredibly fast; startup time aiming to be under Â±40.0 ms. As a developer, 
I understand the frustrating experiences of **slow** code editors.
- **Modularity**. We aim to be completely modular, to not get in your way. 
We are opinionated; but we give you all the control you need. It's always possible to overwrite our defaults.

## Features

- Lightweight and minimalistic Neovim setup
- Utilizes lazy loading with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for faster startup times
- Integrated Language Server Protocol (LSP) support using [lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig)
